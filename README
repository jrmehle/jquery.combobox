## jquery.ComboBox

## What is it?
text input + select list = combobox

## How do I use it?

$( "#my_select_list" ).combobox();

## Disclaimer

This is a modified version of the comobobox widget found on the jQuery UI Autocomplete demo page.
The original can be found here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox

Internally, combobox uses the autocomplete widget. I've added the ability to pass through the appendTo, autoFocus, and open options.
